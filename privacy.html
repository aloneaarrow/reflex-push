    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="section note">
        <p><strong>Reflex Push</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information may be processed when you use the app and your choices and rights.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1) Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local game data:</strong> Scores and progress are stored on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Ads:</strong> The app displays ads using Google AdMob. Ad-related identifiers (such as the Advertising ID) may be processed by Google and its partners to serve and measure ads, depending on your consent and region.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Games:</strong> If you choose to sign in, Google Play Games may process account-related data to provide leaderboards/achievements.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> In certain regions (EEA/UK/Switzerland) we request consent for personalized ads using Google’s consent SDK (UMP). You can change your choice later.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2) Information We Process</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Personal information</h3>
        <p>The app does not ask you to enter your name, address, or phone number.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Game data (stored locally)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In-game scores, achievements, settings, and statistics saved on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Advertising data (AdMob)</h3>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to show ads. Depending on your device settings, region, and consent, ad serving may involve processing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID).</li>
            <li>Approximate location (derived from IP), device information (OS/version), app usage events related to ads (impressions/clicks), and diagnostics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not receive your Advertising ID directly; this data is handled by Google / ad partners under their policies.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Google Play Games (optional)</h3>
        <p>If you use Google Play Games sign-in, Google may process information required to provide the service (for example, your Play Games profile and leaderboard/achievement interactions). This is managed by Google under their policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide gameplay features (local scores, settings, achievements).</li>
            <li>To show ads and measure performance (AdMob).</li>
            <li>To provide leaderboards/achievements when you sign in with Google Play Games.</li>
            <li>To maintain security, prevent abuse, and fix bugs (diagnostics).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK/Switzerland)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we rely on the following legal bases where applicable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> (for personalized ads and related storage/access where required).</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (for non-personalized ads measurement, app security, and basic analytics/diagnostics where permitted).</li>
            <li><strong>Contract/performance of a service</strong> (to deliver core gameplay functionality you request).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5) Consent for Ads (GDPR / UK GDPR / Switzerland)</h2>
        <p>In regions where required, we use Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to request and store your ad consent choices. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accept or refuse personalized ads where offered.</li>
            <li>Change your choice later using the in-app privacy/consent options (if available) or by resetting Advertising ID / ad personalization settings on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: If you refuse consent for personalized ads, you may still see non-personalized/contextual ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6) U.S. State Privacy Rights (e.g., California, Virginia, Colorado, etc.)</h2>
        <p>Depending on your state, you may have rights such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right to know/access the categories of personal information processed.</li>
            <li>Right to delete certain personal information (where applicable).</li>
            <li>Right to opt out of “sale” or “sharing” of personal information (as those terms are defined by certain state laws).</li>
            <li>Right to opt out of targeted advertising.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Do Not Sell or Share / Opt-out:</strong> To opt out of interest-based/personalized advertising, you can use your device settings (ad personalization / Advertising ID reset) and, where available, the in-app consent controls. AdMob also provides controls through Google settings.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly sell personal information for money. However, some ad tech practices may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising under certain laws. We honor opt-out signals through our consent flow where supported.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7) Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we’ll take appropriate steps.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
